# üéÆ Cube Reflex

## Overview
**Cube Reflex** is an incredibly challenging game developed in Unity using C#. In this fast-paced game, players control a cube that accelerates as it moves forward on a dynamic floor, encountering obstacles that test their reflexes and agility.

## Game Features
- **Dynamic Movement**: The cube starts off slowly and gradually increases speed, providing a thrilling challenge.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: The game features dynamically generated obstacles that not only appear on the floor but also adjust in difficulty based on the player‚Äôs speed. As the cube accelerates, the frequency and positioning of obstacles change, ensuring that players face increasingly complex challenges. Players must react quickly and strategically navigate these obstacles to continue progressing.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Navigate through obstacles, aiming for the highest score by surviving as long as possible.

## Obstacles
In **Cube Reflex**, obstacles are a core gameplay element designed to challenge players' reflexes. Here's how they work:

- **Dynamic Generation**: Obstacles are generated in real-time as the cube moves forward. The game's engine places obstacles at various points on the floor, which players must navigate around.
  
- **Difficulty Scaling**: As the player's speed increases, the game dynamically adjusts the position and frequency of obstacles. This means that players will encounter more obstacles in a shorter amount of time, requiring quicker reactions and sharper reflexes.
  
- **Types of Obstacles**: There are various types of obstacles that may appear, each designed to test different skills (e.g., timing, coordination). These can include stationary blocks, moving hazards, or complex patterns that require strategic movement.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:
- **Assets**: Contains all game assets, including models, textures, and audio files.
